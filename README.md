## Challenges
- The approach of the project was that we saw that are 6 navbars that are attached to the homepage. So that we have dived the project into parts.
- Another problem was to merge all of the files in a proper sequence which was again a difficult task for us because while merging and connecting all the pages some of the pages had the same name, and while running the site it was redirecting to some other pages so it was difficult too.
- Another issue is about adjusting the Navbar is one of the difficult things, on the home page, we had added the sliding video part which has taken a long time.
- The popup part for the Navbar is the major task for us because when hovering on the Navbar we should get the popup in the correct way.
